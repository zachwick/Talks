# Title:
Getting Started with Python-backed Web Apps

# Audience Level:
Novice++/Intermediate-

# Brief Outline: (1 Paragraph, 400 chars max)
So you want to make a web app, but don't know where to start? Then
this is the tutorial for you! By the end of this session you will have
written a single page javascript todo/inventory tracking webapp (TBD)
that uses python for the server and API! This session assumes that you
have a working knowledge of both javascript and python, but you don't
need to be an expert in either to build something meaningful. 

# Detailed Abstract: (Detailed description and outline)

## The layers of a webapp
* Database
    * We are using MariaDB (a FOSS drop-in replacement for MySql)
* Server
    * Web.py (Written in Python by Aaron Schwartz)
* Client App
    * Otherwise known as the website (JS, CSS, HTML) 

## Some acronyms and buzzwords!
* HTTP
    * (H)yper(T)ext (T)ransfer (P)rotocol
	* The language that our webapp speaks
* REST
    * (R)(E)presentational (S)tate (T)ransfer
	* A way to talk from server to client-side (and vice-versa)
* API
    * (A)pplication (P)rogramming (I)nterface
	* The endpoints on our server that the webapp talks to
* CRUD
    * (C)reate, (R)ead, (U)pdate, (D)elete
	* The four HTTP verbs that drive our interactions with a REST API

## Required Software
* MariaDB/Mysql
* web.py
* A web browser
* A text editor
* python2 installation
* nodejs
    * grunt-cli installed globally

## Project Structure
You should clone a skeleton repo from here:
https://github.com/ZachWick/webpy_skeleton.git
* app.py
    * web.py API definition
* COPYING.md
    * Project-wide licensing information
* docs/
    * Docco autogenerated JS documentation
	* API/
	    * web.py API documentation
* Gruntfile.sj
    * A NodeJS based JS build system config file
* model.py
    * Our 'ORM' layer definition
* package.json
    * A JSON object that defines some project attributes (Used with
	the Grunt build system)
* README.md
    * Project-wide readme file
* schema.sql
    * A schema dump of the current database structure
* src/
    * The filesystem subtree where the 'source' files live
	* js/lib/
	    * Various JavaScript libraries
	* js/models/
        * The BackboneJS model definitions
	* js/views/
	    * The BackboneJS view definitions
	* less/
	    * The LESS files that will be compiled into CSS for the webapp
* static/
    * The directory that the webapp loads resources from.
	* The various build steps place their output in this directory
* templates/
    * The BackboneJS view templates and the web.py HTML templates live
      here
* tests/
    * Unit Tests live here
