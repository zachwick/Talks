RevEng 101 (Reverse Engineering 101)

Have you always wondered how your favorite computer program worked,
but you couldn't look at the source code? Do you just enjoy reading
assembly code more than higher level languages? Did those questions
sound like jibberish to you?
Then come to RevEng 101 at All Hands Active. This class will introduce
you to the concepts of disassembling binaries, analying ELF files, and
figuring out how programs work without reading the source code. The
are no prerequisites for this course, but some programming experience
of any kind would be helpful. Based on how this initial course goes,
there is the possibility of a whole track of RevEng classes, so come
and show your support for end-user fiddling!
Class attendees should bring either a GNU/Linux system of their own
(even a Raspberry Pi will suffice or a GNU/Linux VM) or should contact
the instructor (zach@zachwick.com) about using a borrowed
machine.
The class will be on April 14 from 6p - 10p and a $10 donation towards
the operating expenses of AHA is encouraged.
